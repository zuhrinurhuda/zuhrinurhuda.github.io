				<h2>Our Approach</h2>
				<p>If we were to design an identity for a coffee shop, we’d visit the coffee shop, chat with customers, and drink coffee there until we could really understand what made that coffee shop special. Only then would we begin to develop ideas and apply our craftsmanship. Read more about our approach to design and strategy.</p>

				<h2>Our Services</h2>
				<p>Our work is contemporary, has a character of its own and creates a strong visual impression – but it is always based on our design process. Our process means an analytical approach to the task that ensures real and measurable effects and adds value for both you and your audience.</p>

				<h2>Our Values </h2>
				<p>Think of an agency relationship as a new romance. Would you be looking for someone who agrees with everything you say, does everything you tell him to do, and sits by the phone all day waiting for your call?  Or would you rather be with an opinionated partner who isn’t afraid to challenge you, someone with the guts to ask the seemingly stupid questions that really need to be asked? Precisely.</p>
